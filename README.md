# Project_1-RE-DataViz
DU Bootcamp Data Visualization Project 1 Real Estate Analysis

Overview/Summary:
In this project our scope was to determine the best areas in the US to purchase a single-family home as an investment/rental property. Our approach was to 
1.	Target high quality data sources.
2.	Load the data to Jupyter Notebook for evaluation.
3.	Clean and merge the data for visualization

Data Sources:
•	Zillow data csv

•	Realtor.com csv
    •	Clean data set that gave us median and average home listing prices for 50 states.
    •	Merged with rental dataset for analysis to make one data set for visualization. 

•	World Population Review.com csv

•	Realty Mole Property API
    •	This API allowed us to pull rental min, max, and average price by number of bedrooms for an ID of Zip code.
    •	Ran an analysis of rental data collected for specified zip codes.

Analysis Conclusion:
    WV has the highest and MT has the lowest rental income percentage compared to home price among 50 states
    Top 5 cities with best return
        Calumet City, IL
        Camden, NJ
